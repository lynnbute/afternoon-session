else:
    print("The key 'size' does not exist in the dictionary.")
    
# 7     Write a python program to loop through the dictionary above
for key, value in Shoes.items():
    print("Key:", key)
    print("Value:", value)
    print("---")
    
# 8 Write a python program to remove “color” from the dictionary.
